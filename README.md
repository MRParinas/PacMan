# PacMan

The "PacMan" project embarked as the fourth milestone in my fascinating journey through the world of web development. With my foundational understanding cemented through earlier projects that introduced me to the creation and manipulation of shapes, and the dynamic animations of bouncing balls, this endeavor plunged me deeper into the intricacies of JavaScript, pushing my coding skills to new heights. Unlike its predecessors, the "PacMan" project was not just about moving shapes or controlling basic animations but about bringing a classic arcade character to life with smooth, continuous movement across the screen, all while toggling through multiple images to simulate the iconic open-and-close mouth motion.

As a 50-year-old student navigating the coding realm for the first time, this project presented a steep learning curve. The challenge was not only in understanding the technical aspects but in the coordination of multiple elements and effects to create a coherent, interactive simulation. This project demanded more than a rudimentary grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”it required a nuanced understanding of how these languages could interact dynamically to simulate the movement and behavior of one of the most recognizable figures in video game history.

Diving into the project, the initial steps involved setting up the HTML structure, which was relatively straightforward. However, the complexity quickly escalated as I ventured into JavaScript, where I had to manage multiple images representing PacMan's various states (open mouth facing different directions, closed mouth, etc.) and control their sequential display to mimic the character's iconic chomping motion as it moved across the screen.

Implementing movement logic for PacMan introduced me to new JavaScript concepts and functions. I had to calculate PacMan's position on the screen, detect boundaries to reverse its direction, and simultaneously switch between images to create the illusion of motion. This aspect of the project significantly deepened my understanding of JavaScript's capabilities in creating interactive web elements and managing time intervals for animation sequences.

CSS played a crucial role in styling the webpage, ensuring that PacMan's movements were visually appealing and smooth. The styling had to be precise, as the visual feedback was instant and any misalignment or abrupt change would disrupt the animation's fluidity, detracting from the user experience.

This project was by far the most time-consuming and challenging of my early ventures into coding. It demanded patience, persistence, and a willingness to delve into and troubleshoot complex problems. There were moments of frustration and doubt, where the code didn't behave as expected, and debugging seemed endless. Yet, each obstacle overcome was a triumph, contributing to a growing sense of accomplishment and competence.

The fulfillment I experienced upon completing the "PacMan" project was unparalleled. What began as a daunting task evolved into a testament to my development as a coder. It showcased my ability to integrate multiple web technologies, breathe life into a static webpage, and create an engaging, interactive experience reminiscent of a beloved classic game.

Reflecting on this journey, the "PacMan" project was more than just a learning experience; it was a milestone that illustrated how far I had come from my initial forays into HTML and CSS. It reinforced my belief in lifelong learning and the idea that it's never too late to embrace new challenges. The skills and confidence gained from this project have laid a solid foundation for future endeavors in web development, opening the door to more complex projects and further exploration of the potential of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# How to Run the "PacMan" Program:
1. Access the Project Files: The first step is to ensure you have access to the project files, including the HTML (index.html), CSS (pacman.css), and JavaScript (pacman.js) files, along with the necessary PacMan images (PacMan1.png, PacMan2.png, PacMan3.png, PacMan4.png).
2. Open the HTML File: Open the index.html file in a web browser of your choice. This will render the PacMan page, displaying the images of PacMan at their starting positions.
3. Interact with PacMan: As soon as the page loads, the PacMan images will begin their animation.
4. Enjoy the Animation: Watch as the PacMan characters bounce back and forth across the screen, reversing direction upon reaching the screen's edges.

# Suggestions for Future Improvements:
1. User Control: Introduce keyboard or mouse controls that allow users to change the direction of PacMan's movement. This could involve adding event listeners for keyboard keys or mouse clicks to dynamically alter PacMan's direction and enhance user interaction.
2. Collision Detection: Implement basic collision detection logic that allows PacMan to interact with other elements on the page. This could be the foundation for a simple game where PacMan collects dots or avoids ghosts.
3. Add Ghosts: For a more authentic PacMan experience, introduce ghost characters with their own set of images and animations. I could probably learn to program simple algo for the ghosts, making them chase after PacMan or move randomly across the screen.
4. Scorekeeping: Implement a scoring system that rewards users for certain actions, like avoiding ghosts for a set amount of time or "eating" dots placed across the screen.
5. Sound Effects: Add classic PacMan sound effects to enhance the visual animations. This would involve me learning how to work with audio in web development, adding a new layer of complexity and immersion to the project.
6. Responsive Design: Ensure the game is fully responsive and looks great across different devices and screen sizes. This might involve adjusting the size of the PacMan characters and the layout based on the viewport dimensions.
7. Performance Optimization: As I try to add more features, I will try to keep an eye on the performance. I will try to learn how to use tools like Google Chrome's DevTools to analyze and optimize the animation's performance for smoother rendering.
